Here are some official SIG Boba events:
- [Chicago: KubeCon NA '23](/)
- [Amsterdam: KubeCon EU '23](/events/ams-kubecon-eu-23)

If you would like to organize your own SIG Boba gethering (large or small)
our ask is that you are inclusive of others and use the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md) for the event.

Many informal gatherings have already taken place in the community from Toronto to Shanghai.

Please reach out on Twitter or Slack so that we can promote your meetup :)
